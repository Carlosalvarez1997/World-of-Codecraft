WORLD OF CODECRAFT - A TEXT BASED FIGHTING GAME

World of Codecraft is a text based fighting game in which the user may control a battle betweeen two defined players via their own respective attack buttons.
This project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. As the project grows and scales, we hope to add features such as equip armor which reduces damage taken, use/equip
spells which use a new resource called mana to heal a player or cast fireballs, implement a turn based system, and more.
